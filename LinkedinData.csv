This realisation began for me twenty+ years ago when I moved from Mumbai to Bangalore and was terribly unhappy to see plastic and paper waste burning in the streets of this beautiful city. I am grateful that I decided to shift focus from frustration to meaningful change on the ground.

I started NGO Saahas in 2001.  In those early days the NGO looked at awareness around plastic pollution and also implementation of pilot projects with a focus on decentralised solutions for  wet and dry waste       
             
Our second Saahas entity was registered as a Private Limited Company in 2013. Today as the  CEO of Saahas Zero Waste, it is satisfying to see the beginnings of change through the environmental and social change we are able to implement on the ground. The company is focussed on resource recovery through collection, aggregation and processing of municipal solid waste. We  work with corporate campuses to implement zero waste systems.  We  also work with brands to support them fulfill their EPR compliance to plastic waste and e-waste. The company manages around 100 tonnes of waste per day.  

Both entities believe and in fact demonstrate the implementation of how nature, people and technology can work closely to recover resources which can be put back to use . 
 
I  have had diverse work experiences. I  moved to Bangalore from Mumbai in 1995. I am  a former journalist who previously worked with  the Times of India group and BusinessWorld Magazine. Earlier I worked with the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce. My very first job was that of a tour guide where I put to good use my German speaking skills as I proudly introduced India to visiting German tourists         

I  have  a degree in Life Sciences from Bombay University.",

I started my journey as a civil engineer working with large real estate companies, and later on, I trained and led a 700-person team at Housing.com at just 24 years old. I was also a part of CEO's office at the 3000 member strong Housing.com. 

However, my passion for solving social problems led me to start my own clean-tech startup, Clean-Water, in 2016. Clean-Water was created to address the issues of water scarcity and pollution, and I'm proud to say that in just a few years, we had a positive impact on over 28,000 lives and treated 100,000 liters of wastewater every hour for both private and government clients. 

Today, Clean-Water specializes in waterbody restoration projects using floating wetlands. These floating islands not only provide a visually pleasing touch to the water bodies, but they also cleanse the water and also restores the ecology & biodiversity. 

We have developed over 16 floating wetland products and worked on over 12 water-bodies in 5 different states. Clean-Water continues to make a difference in the world.

I was honored with the titles of ""Water Hero"" and ""Jal Prahari"" by the Jal Shakti Ministry and the Water Resources Department of the Government of India, in recognition of my efforts in transforming the lakes of Indore.

I was honored to give a TEDx talk at my school, Choithram School Indore, showcasing my journey in water restoration and clean tech. It was a full circle moment, returning to educate on the importance of water preservation and sustainable technology.

My mission is to revitalize and preserve 1,00,000 water-bodies, ignite a movement for nationwide water-body restoration, empower local entrepreneurs, establish a sustainable and profitable organization that benefits all stakeholders, inspire the next generation of climate and social entrepreneurs, and become a leading voice in driving positive social change beyond water restoration.

Growing up in the Himalayas, after moving to urban cities like Mumbai, I was struck by a different reality: massive pollution, disconnected society, and unsustainable lifestyles. This wasn't just an environmental issue; it was a market gap crying out for smart, tech-driven, scalable solutions.

That's why I started Earth5R. Our work isn't just about planting trees or cleaning up rivers and beaches.

At Earth5R, we're not just creating a scalable, tech-driven solution with a global footprint; we're carving out a lucrative niche in the urban sustainability and environmental tech market. We're looking for collaborators who share our vision for sustainable urban development and see the immense business potential.

This includes innovators in environmental technology, community leaders, businesses keen on integrating sustainable practices, and investors looking to capitalize on a booming market for impactful, tech-driven solutions.

With a resolute commitment to turning concepts into tangible realities, Rahul has consistently pursued the transformation of ideas into realities with actionable outcomes.. At ReCircle, we engineer waste management solutions that enable businesses and individuals to do their part for sustainable development.

But here's the magic: ReCircle isn't just a company. It's a movement reshaping the waste industry. We've already diverted over 100,000+ MT of waste (that's equal to 16,666 elephants!) from oceans and landfills. And it doesn't stop here. We're also empowering 3100+ Safai Sathis -   our informal waste workers, across a 300+ collector network to create a revolution; originating in India, spreading across the world!
Our journey is marked by accolades like the BW Social Impact Leader in Recycling (2022), and gaining the privilege of sharing ReCircle’s latest projects at prestigious conferences like Mobile World Congress Africa & Spain & NY Times Climate Conference (2022).

In the waste industry, you’re always one step behind; waste is constant, waste is never ending, waste is permanent. The thrill of exploring new ways to get on the same page is my raison d’etre.

I envision to help solve the environmental problems for the current and the future generations. 

I have always been fascinated about the possibilities of technology in solving some real-world problems. My enthusiasm in hardware designing since my college times had led me to be noticed by a senior, who asked me to join him in starting-up of a venture as a core member where I would be designing different hardware products for Industrial requirements. That was the turning point where I chose the path of entrepreneurship and set my foot out for solving some real-world problems utilizing what I have learnt. Fascinated by the idea of empowering business results through technology, I embarked on an enriching journey, wearing multiple hats in terms of responsibilities, starting from product designing and manufacturing, setting up the supply chain, managing the operations and customer service, building the right team and managing and motivating them and leveraging their skills for achieving common goals. 

These varied positions with 7 years of startup experience have prepared me for my vision to become a change maker for a technology driven society to help solve the climate crisis and thus started the journey of Aurassure, making the Aura (environment) assured for everyone.

1. Making existing ETPs/ STPs more efficient so that there are savings in operational costs, water can be recycled without fear of Coliforms, suppression of foul odour and meeting PCB norms more stringently. We are already working with P&G, ITC, Sab Miller, Berger Paints etc as a result. 

2. Cleaning up lakes are large water bodies. A lake was cleaned up by us for DDA (Delhi Development Authority).

3. Carrying out in-situ bio-remediation of drains. We have received an order from MoEF for the same.

4. Making existing entities into green units where we address wastewater, solid waste & convert existing gardens into organic gardens. Work has already finished for Ajit Bhawan, Jodhpur, The Lawrence School, Sanawar etc. Each of them

5. Assisting large Companies in carrying out scientific composting like United phosphorous, IL& FS etc. 

6. Created vertical pillar to eradicate hunger. Food can be grown on your terrace or balcony now!

7. Energy Pillars to give organic nutrients to trees without making compost.

8. We have developed 42 different methods of composting to suit any biomass or situation. 

Have run projects for World Bank, UN, State Governments, NGOs etc. We not only design projects, but implement them professionally as well.",

again. This is the rebirth of materials that were once exiled to towering landfills or incinerators.

Background:
The advent of the mining industry in the industrial era brought about an obsession with virgin
raw materials. Globally it was the era of Production.
Being a demand focused economy, the focus was on producing. Raw materials were pumped
into powerful machines that turned them into shiny new products. Great Packaging’s
comprising of layers of Plastic and non-biodegradable materials were used to influence buyers.
While the economy boomed, Manufacturing Companies became Billions of $’s in size but it left
behind a cold trail of little to large pieces of industrial scrap produced with each manufacturing
operation of each Product. Not only was this the beginning of a catastrophe for the
environment, copious amounts of energy and resources for manufacturing in the first place
were wasted.
The Indian subcontinent has a rich tradition of recycling. This largely informal sector collects
and segregates profuse amounts of industrial waste on a daily basis. Many of the materials we
regard as waste have the potential to become raw materials for new products and processes.

What we do:
My projects led through company “Material Library of India” are focused on remodeling the
use of industrial waste materials by combining the knowledge and skills of traditional crafts
with modern materials.
In one process, the sophistication of traditional craft is capable of turning the most unrelenting
of materials into fluid surfaces through complex weaves. Multitude of these creative processes
can enable an organic transformation of industrial waste into usable products.
At Material Library of India, we are able to generate and sustain a latent value in industrial
waste materials that can be harvested. This is a conscious step to encourage emerging makers
to use these non-hazardous waste materials as legitimate resources to make everyday
products, ranging from furniture to lifestyle accessories, from textiles to ceramics.
Modern Manufacturing not only needs to be clean and more Environment friendly, it also
needs to relook at the existing processes to monetize every single ounce of waste. This helps
the environment and the bottom-line of the company.

Material Library of India helps create a two way WIN, a win for the Companies it consults to
help monetize the waste as also as much to help build a sustainable Environment for",

Recently, I began to devote my energies towards Environmental issues and sustainable living, an area that has been a matter of deep concern to me. Consequently, I now find myself organically emerging as a Social Entrepreneur, that offers Integrated Solid Waste Management Services to Corporates, Apartment complexes & Institutions.
 
To witness the gradual defiling of the city that I have loved, and to see what has become of it today has been distressing.  
I was disturbed by the filth all around us, the plight of the sweeper community, and the damage our lifestyle is causing the Planet I felt compelled to stop simply complaining and begin actually doing something to rectify things myself.
 
My guiding principle became ""Be the change you want to see in the world.""
So I decided to study waste, pollution and sustainable development on the ground. I spent a year tracking and understanding the various segments - whether it was the scrap dealer, the sweeper who dug into our waste, the aggregators, the recyclers, or the manufacturers, I deep dived with all those connected with the world of waste.
 
They say ""Practise before you preach."" Hence, I started with myself, my home and my society. From all that I had learned, I found and tested methods to make my residential society the first zero waste to landfill CHS in the Ward! Today, we are proud to be a showcased as a successful case study where 90% of our waste is recycled. 
With this successful pilot, I realised that zero waste is an achievable possibility.   
Now, I have taken up the challenge of making a zero waste locality and then a zero waste city a reality. 
  
Zero waste has to be a citizen movement. I team up with the Municipal Corporation of Mumbai, for initiatives on zero waste and sustainable living and work towards co-ordinating efforts of all stakeholders.
  
We all need to contribute. We all need to Rethink our lifestyle.  We all need to understand that:
Its ok to Reduce your wants.  
Its ok to Repair broken durables or clothes.  
Its ok to Refuse things that are causing harm to the planet.  
Its ok to Reuse your sisters clothes. 
If you can Repurpose it - then its not waste!
  
As a CHS, we can make you rebate ready, as a Corporate we can help with your CSR cause, as an Institution we can train young minds.
If you, your society or organisation would like to learn more about how we can go zero waste to landfill or together, rebuild healthier, sustainable systems – write to us at earthcallingmumbai@gmail.com",

Archeological evidence said that humans had a way of managing their waste even before landfills and incinerators were developed. In many archeological sites, dumping pits were discovered where early people were believed to throw in their waste. In the course of history, waste regulations were enacted. This suggests that waste management is not a modern principle but in fact a natural response to existence. Humans naturally know what to do with their waste as evidenced by the instituted 
waste management systems in the pre-modern and modern forms.However, along with global industrialization and population explosion, waste production blew out of proportion, endangering the environment and threatening humans and other living things. With the environmental issues raised here and there, there seems to be a need to remind humans of the importance of waste management. Education and awareness campaigns play a great part here. Not all people after all are aware that the one piece of waste material they are sending to landfills or incinerators constitutes a greater threat to the environment. Recycling of dry waste and composting of wet waste is what we at Sanjeevani S3 advocate.

The pursuit of 'Zero Discharge' in industrial processes represents a significant environmental aspiration, aiming to recycle all waste without any pollutants released into the environment. While achieving absolute zero discharge might seem elusive, Asiatic's 'Patented Non Thermal Zero Discharge System'® emerges as a practical solution, particularly tailored for the Pharma, Chemical, Textile, Power Plants, Fresh Water R.O. Reject Water, and other industries grappling with wastewater RO challenges.

Addressing the Zero Discharge Myth:

In the realm of wastewater treatment, achieving a true 'Zero Discharge' is often considered a challenging myth. Asiatic recognizes the complexity of evolving treated wastewater discharge standards and provides a pragmatic approach to meet stringent pollution control authority requirements.

Practical Solutions for Diverse Industries:

As industries strive to comply with Zero Discharge norms set by Pollution Control Boards, Asiatic's Non-Thermal Zero Discharge System proves invaluable. Designed with precision, this patented system caters to the specific needs of various sectors, offering a practical alternative to conventional technologies such as Reverse Osmosis, Incineration (thermal), and Solar Evaporation.

Overcoming Conventional Limitations:

Traditional methods, including Reverse Osmosis and Incineration, come with inherent limitations. Asiatic's Non-Thermal Zero Discharge System surpasses these drawbacks, providing a reliable and sustainable solution for minimizing reject water streams.

Exceptional Cost Efficiency:

A standout feature of Asiatic's solution lies in its remarkably low Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and Operating Expenditure (OPEX). This not only makes it economically viable but also positions it as an industry leader in delivering cost-effective and environmentally responsible wastewater management solutions.

Free Consultation for Your Wastewater Challenges:

For businesses dealing with ETP, STP, WWRO, and R.O. Reject discharge challenges, Asiatic offers a complimentary consultation. Reach out to us at abhi9824054002@yahoo.com to explore how our expertise can assist you in navigating and optimizing your wastewater treatment processes.

Corporations look at circular economy like an opportunity but are unaware of how to translate it to reality. My co-founder Suraj and I are changing that through Recity, with our data-backed strategic solutions that make circularity suitable for customers across various business categories!

I am a first-gen entrepreneur in my family, running my second business, while also raising a teenager who innocently inspires me everyday.

At Recity, ‘plastic’ and ‘people’ are at the center of all the problem-solving I do by identifying challenges, breaking them down, structuring solutions and making the unimaginable happen. While short-lived pilot projects and products are thrilling, the real satisfaction comes from bringing scale and taking risks to sustain that scale!

The entrepreneurship journey, from my 21+ years of experience, has been my gateway into changing the narratives of ‘failure’ and setting new benchmarks of resilience. As Recity’s strength grew to a strong 200+ in the last six years, one of my core focus areas has been to shape Recity’s culture into diverse, gender neutral and high EQ-driven teams!

Beyond my professional background, skills and vision, if there are 4 facts about me that you wish to take back with you, you must know that -
- I believe and then I manifest.
- I am intuitive, and that’s been my biggest strength in visualizing what most can’t!
- I appreciate logic, but I love when logical conversations are combined with emotion & empathy!
- I find reasons to keep learning, and just never settle.

We must acknowledge that we are in the middle of an anthropogenic mass extinction. Humans have drastically altered the physical order of atmosphere, land, and water systems. Climate adaptation is a grand challenge of our times. 

At WELL Labs, we are working with our partner organisations to develop innovative evidence backed solutions for better water management. We work with grassroots NGOs, philanthropies, and governments to ensure that the most effective solutions are funded to maximise impact. Please reach out if you think we must collaborate.

I lead the Technical Consulting track at WELL Labs where we combine on-ground hydrologic tests and cutting-edge remote sensing tools to find and develop cost-effective solutions.

In the past I have been part of governments, NGOs, and water consulting companies to understand the solutions each has to offer in the water management domain.

As I understand it, the solution to climate change adaptation lies in working closely with the communities and helping them manage their water and land better, and to strike a balance between their livelihoods and environmental sustainability.

This guiding principle has shaped my career and driven my success over the past two decades. I am an experienced professional with diverse expertise. My journey began as a mechanical engineer in 1998, before transitioning to marine engineering, where I honed my skills for three rewarding years.

In 2003, I entered the dynamic telecommunications industry as a supply chain expert, significantly contributing to the sector's growth and efficiency until 2006. Empowered by a passion for innovation and entrepreneurship, I founded my own telecommunications company in 2006. We excelled in telecom tower site selection, civil construction, and material supply, becoming a key player in the industry.

Driven by a dedication to environmental sustainability, I founded a pioneering venture in 2015 focused on environmental impact assessments for infrastructure, industries, and mining companies. Today, we are recognized as one of India's premier environmental consultants, having successfully completed over 2,500 projects nationwide. My commitment to protecting our natural surroundings has been consistently acknowledged by industry leaders.

Our ventures have since expanded to include solid waste management and wastewater treatment plant design, installation, and commissioning. By embracing sustainability, we aim to make a positive impact on the environment and contribute to a greener world.

As I continue this rewarding journey, guided by the belief that ""If you want to win this world, win yourself first,"" I am eager to forge new partnerships, make a meaningful difference, and embrace opportunities that align with my vision of a sustainable and progressive future.

Over the past 13 years, I have successfully built several companies including:

#Synod Bioscience - Environmental solutions

#nanoFarm - a smart farm company

#WonderBin - ultra portable W2E systems 

#Biopower - Waste to Energy Systems for Industries

#naturGas - manufacturer of Bio-CNG from waste materials.

I believe that every company has a responsibility to be sustainable, and that by using the latest technologies and innovations, we can create a better world for future generations. I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow, and I am passionate about working with others to build a more sustainable and equitable future.

If you share a similar passion for sustainability, I would love to connect with you and explore how we can work together to create a better world.

After graduation, I have worked with some of the famous Hospitality and Cinema Giants and earned some of the most important skills in the last 5 years of work experience is that every infant stage of business needs minimum 2 skill, i.e., Public Relations and Sales. If you are good in this, then anyone can easily trust on you and spend their time and money on your business. Once you will get this, then Operations is another skill that you need to run your business smoothly (sometimes you have to work with the operations team on very ground level) but make sure to achieve a 100% customer satisfaction, your operations team must be sufficient in manpower, well equipped and trained to provide at that level of service which customer genuinely wants. 100% Customer Satisfaction strategy definitely helps you in marketing yourself among other customers and investors apart from other marketing strategies.
 
If you have all those 5 skills, then Yes, you can run a business successfully and basis of all skill set, I have started my business in the year 2021, under the name of PEST DEFENCE. After serving my skills in one of the renowned pest control company from year 2020 to 2022, I observed that Pest control Products and Services can be further upscaled and modified in that way, so that people can get some awareness on this and their living environment will also not harmed. 

Currently our company deals with pest & termite control, Bird Management and COVID disinfectant services. We are also providing pest control products which you can further use by yourselves in your working and living surroundings. 

We have also taken a step forward and started working on a few of the pest control chemicals, which can also be helpful to both of us and other living beings that are eventually harmed with the pesticides.
Our motive to make a ""PEST FREE ENVIRONMENT"" so that we can help our Government and Society to make a healthy, disease and Virus free Environment. 

You can also join our pest defence army, we are always available to welcome such warriors who protect our society from deadly disease and viruses.",

Currently, I am focused on supporting sustainable livelihoods for rural and tribal communities through nature-based activities. To fulfill this mission, I have joined IMPCA (Impact Capital and Advisory), where I assist companies in achieving their CSR goals, and carbon neutrality while offering end-to-end support to grassroots NGOs working in tribal and rural areas. Another initiative is www.aadivasi.org, where we are trying to focus on two core missions: Empowering users to change lives and preserve traditional art & craft.

My core competencies encompass strategic management, business development, start-up funding and management, carbon credit project development, and NGO partnership management. These skills enable me to navigate complex challenges and drive meaningful change within organizations and communities.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I am enthusiastic about investing in and mentoring social enterprises and NGOs. I believe in the power of collaboration and collective action to create a sustainable and equitable future.

""Why me?"" 
--------------------------------------------------

This is one question I have been asking myself all my life. Right from my childhood, when a most unfortunate accident left me badly burnt, damaging even my face. It did scar me but never stopped me from working even harder for success. 
I grew up with a lot of complexes but never gave up. I managed to overcome my struggles and went on to make a name for myself in the world of Advertising and Media. I loved the profession, the thrill of launching campaigns, speaking at public forums, I got the opportunity to do it all. I was counted among the top youth creative leaders. Things were going great for me until another tragedy struck. 

One night, while riding my motorcycle, I met with an accident. It was a miracle I didn't die. But it was so severe, I was in coma for  months. Chances of my revival were very bleak. My family was told that I would never walk again. 

After I regained consciousness and remained motionless on the bed, I would constantly stare out of the window and think ""Why me?""

There was a tree right outside the window. Somehow, I felt connected to it. We both were so alike. Alive but motionless. 

Over time, I gathered enough strength to get up, to stand on my own feet. Now when I look back, my biggest moment of strength was refusing the help of crutches. 

It was like a rebirth. Gradually, I did learn to walk, all over again, taking very small steps. But now I walked with a purpose. To do something more meaningful, more purposeful. 

Today, after having planted more than a million trees, when people  hail me as the Tree Man, I smile to myself and think, ""Thankfully, it's me!"" - An #inspiringTree
